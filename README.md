# Stock-price-prediction-using-EWMA
An R program to determine stock price using Exponential Weighted Moving Average

The project is was designed to help predict stock market prices using Exponential Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) model. The data set was taken from the link "https://www.kaggle.com/code/kp4920/s-p-500-stock-data-time-series-analysis/data".
and was used to predict stock price of companies Google, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and NIKE for their closing prices of the day.

To verify the extent of correctness of the model, cor-relation between the predicted values and the actual values was calculated.

Thank You.
